## Technical Patterns Established

### File Processing Pattern
```python
# Standard pattern used throughout
try:
    # Parse and validate input
    # Generate educational content
    # Create visualizations
    # Provide conversion options
    return success_response
except Exception as e:
    # Comprehensive error handling
    return error_response_with_context
```

### Educational Content Pattern
- Device explanations with real-world context
- Step-by-step instruction breakdown
- Safety considerations at each step
- Progressive complexity introduction

### UI/UX Pattern
- Clear status indicators
- Progressive disclosure of information
- Error prevention with validation
- Graceful error recovery
